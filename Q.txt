1. Transform the json data into a tabular structure (csv) USING CORE PYTHON as shown here:
  ["title", "smdName", "organizationName", "sourceType", "sourceUrl", "icarUrl", "keywords", language]

2. Do the following data analysis using Pandas and matplotlib or seaborn:
  a. Conduct a detailed analysis on missing values?
  b. Calculate the counts of each languages and show it in a count plot
  c. Find distinct organization names and calculate number of records against each and show
   it in a count plot
  d. Find distinct smdnames and calculate number of records against each and show it in a 
  count plot
  e. Extract list of video IDs from icarUrl field. For example, video idea in ica url
   https://krishi.icar.gov.in/video/watch/3748 is 3748. Similarly extract all
  f. Search for a string [case-insensitive] in 'keywords' field and return count 
  (if string found) in each distinct organization name
  g. Search for a string [case-insensitive] in 'title' field and return count 
  (if string found) in each distinct organization name
  h. What is the percentage of organization names pertaining to 'Pulses Research' 
  against the total?
  i. What is the percentage of organization names pertaining to 'Pulses Research'
  against the general 'research' oriented organization names?
  j. What is the percentage of research based organization names against total?
  k. How many distinct titles have non-english characters?

3. Create a framework in flask and expose services so that I get answers to each of the 
above questions by API calls.
   Examples: https://localhost:8080 should list various links
       - getDistinctOrganizationNames
			 - getSmdNames
			 - getVideoIds
			 - searchStringInKeyword
			 - searchStringInTitle
			 - findPercentOrgNamesPulses
			 - findPercentOrgNamesPulsesAgainstResearch
			 - findPercentOrgNamesResearch
	https://localhost:8080/getDistinctOrganizationNames should return the answer to 2(b) 
  above in a tabular way
    ...similar for others.



    // "total": 3739,
